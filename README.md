# Logic Gate
JavaScript app to create and edit logic gate circuits
I've already made a logic gate editor before, but it was quite heavy-weight and restricted

## Key differences
- Components can be placed anywhere (not restricted to grid)
- Component evaluation is evaluated in-order (not randomly)
- Aim to be mostly pure JavaScript
